### Creating Sounds

The sound effects have been created in a tool
called [Lab Chirp](http://labbed.net/software/labchirp/).

The original Lab Chirp files have been included in this directory as `.lch` files.

These were exported as `.wav` files and then converted to `.ogg` files using the
[convert-to-ogg](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg) on-line tool.
